Additionally, the high values of variance, 2.6595e+13 and 115.7352, indicates a wide spread of data points around the mean and high standard deviation, $5,157,034 and 10.75803 acres, indicates greater variability in data points, meaning they’re more spread out from the mean."

It is also important to note that the p-value of 0.874 shows that there is not statistical significant between acre lot size and price of real estate in NYC adn thus the unreliability of the regression model.

    "text": "Conclusion\nBefore the statistically testing and calculations were made on the data from kaggle and realtor.com, the general and more obvious assumption was the larger the property size the higher the listing price of the property would be. However, we can see now that the prices of real estate in New York City does not correlate with the size of the property. The common belief of the relationship between the two variables could not be explained in a densely populated urban area where it would have been in a rural or suburban area. If the controls of the project were accounted for in the linear relationship, it may have changed the outcome of the regression tests."
