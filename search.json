    "title": "Real Estate Pricing Analysis in NYC",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this project, I am analyzing the relationship between the amount of the acres of real estate in New York City to the cost of the property. The common relationship between those two factors of most real estate in the US and around the world is positive where the larger the real estate property the higher the price. However, there may be additional variables and factors that may alter the common positive relationship. The focus of this project is to only show whether or not the prices of real estate prices increases with property size while keeping all other variables/factors as controls.\n\n\n# Downloading packages -------------------------------------------------------\n- Downloading readr from CRAN ...

    "text": "In this project, I am analyzing the relationship between the amount of the acres of real estate in New York City to the cost of the property. The common relationship between those two factors of most real estate in the US and around the world is positive where the larger the real estate property the higher the price. However, there may be additional variables and factors that may alter the common positive relationship. The focus of this project is to only show whether or not the prices of real estate prices increases with property size while keeping all other variables/factors as controls.\n\n\n# Downloading packages -------------------------------------------------------\n- Downloading readr from CRAN ...

Additionally, the high values of variance, 2.6595e+13 and 115.7352, indicates a wide spread of data points around the mean and high standard deviation, $5,157,034 and 10.75803 acres, indicates greater variability in data points, meaning they’re more spread out from the mean."

    "text": "Conclusion\nBefore the statistically testing and calculations were made on the data from kaggle and realtor.com, the general and more obvious assumption was the larger the property size the higher the listing price of the property would be. However, we can see now that the prices of real estate in New York City does not correlate with the size of the property. The common belief of the relationship between the two variables could not be explained in a densely populated urban area where it would have been in a rural or suburban area. If the controls of the project were accounted for in the linear relationship, it may have changed the outcome of the regression tests."
