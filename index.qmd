title: "Real Estate Pricing Analysis in NYC"

## Introduction

In this project, I am analyzing the relationship between the amount of the acres of real estate in New York City to the cost of the property. The common relationship between those two factors of most real estate in the US and around the world is positive where the larger the real estate property the higher the price. However, there may be additional variables and factors that may alter the common positive relationship. The focus of this project is to only show whether or not the prices of real estate prices increases with property size while keeping all other variables/factors as controls.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

real_estate <- read_csv("realtor-data.csv")

# Filter real estate in NYC and remove entire row with null in any column for a one-to-one relationship between x and y
real_estate_nyc <- real_estate %>% 
        filter(state == "New York") %>% 
        filter(city == "New York City") %>% 
        na.omit()

cat("Table 1: Data for Demonstration Project")
real_estate

```


The data used for the project is pulled kaggle where it was extracted from www.realtor.com, a real estate listing website operated by the News Corp subsidiary Move, Inc. and based in Santa Clara, California and one of the most visited real estate websites. The data lists details of each property including number of bedrooms and bathrooms, land size in acres, city, state, zip code, square feet of house size, previous sold date, and current listing or recently sold price.The data that was extracted and will be used in this project consists of historical real estate listing records from realtor.com


## Summary Statistices of the variables

```{r}
# load the data

# summary statistics of Y variable
cat("Table 2: Summary statistics of Real Estate Price")
summary(real_estate_nyc$price)

# variance and standard deviation of Y variable
cat("Table 3: Variance of Real Estate Price")
var(real_estate_nyc$price)
cat("Table 4: Standard deviation of Real Estate Price")
sd(real_estate_nyc$price)

# summary statistics of X variable
cat("Table 5: Summary statistics of Real Estate Property Size")
summary(real_estate_nyc$acre_lot)

# variance and standard deviation of X variable
cat("Table 6: Variance of Real Estate Property Size")
var(real_estate_nyc$acre_lot)
cat("Table 7: Standard deviation of Real Estate Property size")
sd(real_estate_nyc$acre_lot)

```

## Histograms of the variables

```{r}

The two variables, real estate price and property size, are continuous variables. As seen below, average price of a real estate sale in New York City is $3,799,384 and the average property size of a real estate sale is 0.3977 acres.The medians for each variable ($1,775,000 for prices and 0.06 for property size) is significantly less than their respective means meaning the distributions of each variable skews to the right as seen in the above histograms. Additionally, the high values of variance, 2.6595e+13 and 115.7352, indicates a wide spread of data points around the mean and high standard deviation, $5,157,034 and 10.75803 acres, indicates greater variability in data points, meaning they're more spread out from the mean.

## The Relationship between the variables

The covariance of -151,600.6 represents inverse relationship between property size and price in NYC. The correlation of -0.003 represents the direction and extreme weakness of the linear relationship between the two variables. 
## Regression Results


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# OLS regression model

# stargazer table of model
install.packages("stargazer")
library(stargazer)

# correlation between variables
varcor <- cor(real_estate_nyc$acre_lot, real_estate_nyc$price)


#covariance between variables
varcov <- cov(real_estate_nyc$acre_lot, real_estate_nyc$price)


# correlation and covariance table
corcov <- cbind(varcor, varcov)
stargazer(corcov, type = "text", title = "Table 8: Correlation and Covariance of Variables")

# plot of model results with confidence intervals
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# create a model of the relationship between x=acre lot size and y=price of NYC
model <- lm(price ~ acre_lot, data = real_estate_nyc)

stargazer(model, type = "text")

```
![Figure 4: Confidence Interval of Regression Line](Sheet 5.png)

As seen with the value of R squared and the scatterplot, the relationship and correlation between acre lot size and price is very small and unexpected. This is because of the high variability of price at smaller acre lot size. It is also important to note that the p-value of 0.874 shows that there is not statistical significant between acre lot size and price of real estate in NYC adn thus the unreliability of the regression model. Below is a modified scatterplot for observation of the variability of real estate of less than or equal to one acre.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
real_estate_nyc %>% 
        filter(acre_lot <= 1) %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = acre_lot, y = price/1000000)) +
        geom_point() +
        labs(x ="Acre Lot Size", y ="Price (per million $)", title = "Real Estate in NYC" )

```

## Conclusion

Before the statistically testing and calculations were made on the data from kaggle and realtor.com, the general and more obvious assumption was the larger the property size the higher the listing price of the property would be. However, we can see now that the prices of real estate in New York City does not correlate with the size of the property. The common belief of the relationship between the two variables could not be explained in a densely populated urban area where it would have been in a rural or suburban area. If the controls of the project were accounted for in the linear relationship, it may have changed the outcome of the regression tests.
